## DESeq2.rmd:
Thia code is for Differential Gene Expression Analysis using DESeq2. This analysis aims to investigate differential gene expression using the DESeq2 package, 
focusing on the response to dexamethasone treatment.

Objective:
The primary goal of my analysis is to predict whether an individual has chronic kidney disease, making the target variable ‘classification’, which categorizes entries
into ‘ckd’ or not ‘ckd’. This makes it a classification task, as the target variable is categorical.

Significance:
Early detection and intervention of chronic kidney disease (CKD) can significantly improve patient outcomes and give more time for early diagnosis.

Algorithms and approach:
In this project, I plan to employ logistic regression, decision trees, and SVM models followed by Random forest model as an ensemble for decision tree and also 
an ensemble model using the predictions of logistic regression, decision trees, and SVM models. For feature engineering, given the mix of numeric and categorical 
data, I anticipate encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical features.

Model evaluation:
To evaluate the fit of these algorithms, I will use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics are particularly relevant for classification
tasks and will help in assessing the performance of each model. While similar analyses have been conducted on datasets related to kidney disease, my approach will focus 
on a comprehensive exploration of this specific dataset, potentially uncovering new insights. I aim to integrate advanced machine learning techniques and a 
thorough exploratory analysis to understand the complexities of kidney disease prediction. Here I employ Logistic regression model which is a standard choice for binary 
classification tasks and can provide a baseline for performance and Decision tree mdoel which is more complex and can handle non-linear relationships better, followed by 
SVM or a support vector machine. They are particularly effective for classification tasks and can also provide insights into feature importance. My project will differ in 
its detailed focus on the in-depth evaluation of multiple machine learning models, aimed at deriving the most accurate predictions possible.
